                            <h3>Cloudless Personal Health App</h3>
                            <p>The solution is  optimized for a cloudless decentralized and dummy-proof for everyday usage by  any citizen on any health-related business or public institution:</p>
                            <p>Assumptions</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It  is assumed to be secure each device where a copy exists of the medical data.  For instance, it is accepted IOS on the iPhone to be secure.</li>
                                <li>It  is assumed to be secure any exchange platform for the medical data access (in  any hospital for instance).</li>
                                <li>It  Is assumed to be secure any terminal computer for local access to medical data  (local 2 local access). For instance, in regions where there is no Internet  connectivity or in the event of Internet failure.</li>
                                <li>In  the event of an emergency, medical data needs to be accessible with just one  click. For instance, an iris scan or fingerprint read.</li>
                                <li>Medical  data records are the responsibility of a citizen. That is to say, if he/she  forges medical data it won't be on his/her best interest.</li>
                                <li>In  proved cases where the citizen is unable to handle adequately his/her medical  records, a third person should be allowed to do it. If any, the public health  system / private company should be paid by the state to provide such service  free of charge.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Solution  requirements</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A  health data transfer protocol that ensures privacy/secrecy of medical data  across networks that can connect any device for that purpose.</li>
                                <li>A  microservice to keep up to date the latest version all copies of the medical  data of a given citizen any time a device with a copy of the data, connects to  the health data protocol network. For instance, let's say I have 6 copies of my  medical data on 6 different devices at home. Lately, I've been using the same  device, my smartphone for instance, when visiting the doctor in the last couple  of months. Naturally, this device has a more up to date record of my medical  data. Other devices on plugging in into the health network need to update, upon  request, to the latest data records. (is needed some sort of &quot;tracking  ID&quot; for knowing what is the latest version of the medical data)</li>
                            </ul>
                            Medical data access  needs to be made on a local secured network. Only if needed, accessed through  the Internet. For instance, using RFID / NFC technology to do data access, for  instance, in a doctor's office. Or the faster but proprietary transferJet  technology for the same purpose.<br>
