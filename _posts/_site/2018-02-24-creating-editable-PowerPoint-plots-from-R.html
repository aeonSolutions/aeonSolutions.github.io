<p><strong>In this post I am giving a quick overview of how to create editable plots
in PowerPoint from R. These plots are comprised of simple vector-based shapes
and thus allow you to change labels, colours, or text position in seconds.
 Your project managers will love it!</strong>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>R allows us to create great visualisations, but in most data science settings
these need to be presented to key stakeholders and decision makers in
presentations or “slideuments”. Having to make small changes to previously
compiled slots can be time consuming and frustrating. A solution to this common
problem is to keep your plots and graphs editable as a group of vector shapes
in PowerPoint. This way project managers or data scientists themselves can make
small changes without having to re-execute a single line of code.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>We will use a tidyverse approach for creating the plot. Furthermore, the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">officer</code> package enables us to smoothly interact with PowerPoint, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rvg</code>
package is required to save our plots as editable vector graphs.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">R
library(tidyverse)
library(officer)
library(rvg)
</code></p>

<p>For demonstration purposes, let’s create a plot using the diamonds dataset.
NB: I am saving the ggplot object to a variable name, but also displaying the
plot when executing the lines by appending the <code class="highlighter-rouge">; ggp</code> at the end.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">R
# Using diamonds dataset which is shipped with R
ggp &lt;- diamonds %&gt;%
  # Let's simplify things by only considering natural number carats
  mutate(carat = floor(carat)) %&gt;%
  group_by(carat, cut, clarity, color) %&gt;%
  summarise(price = mean(price)) %&gt;%
  # Create a plot of price by carat, colour, cut, and clarity
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, fill = color)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  facet_grid(cut ~ clarity) +
  # Simplify the plot layout a little
  theme_bw() +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()); ggp
</code></p>

<p>Now we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">officer</code> to create a new PowerPoint document and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">rvg::ph_with_vg</code> to drop our ggplot object in there.</p>

<p>```R
# Create a new powerpoint document
doc &lt;- read_pptx()
doc &lt;- add_slide(doc, ‘Title and Content’, ‘Office Theme’)</p>

<h1 id="add-the-plot">Add the plot</h1>
<p>doc &lt;- ph_with_vg(doc, ggobj = ggp, type = ‘body’)</p>

<h1 id="write-the-document-to-a-file">Write the document to a file</h1>
<p>print(doc, target = ‘plot.pptx’)
```</p>

<p>Now open the document in PowerPoint. Right-click and ungroup the plot. Voila!
You should be able to select individual elements, for example the data bars in
the plot, change their colour, move them around, change the text in labels,
and much more. Have a look at the plot below. A cookie for you if you can
find all ten edits that I made in the example.</p>

<p>As always, hope this is helpful. And FYI, I am still looking for a way to
achieve the same result using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code>. If you know one, collect some bounty
