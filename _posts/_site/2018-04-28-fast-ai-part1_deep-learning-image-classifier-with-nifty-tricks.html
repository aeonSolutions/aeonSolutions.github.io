<p><strong>Here I summarise learnings from lesson 1 of the fast.ai course on deep learning.
fast.ai is a deep learning online course for coders, taught by Jeremy Howard.
Its tag line is to “make neural nets uncool again”. I started the class a couple
of days ago and have been impressed with how fast it got me to apply the
methods, an approach described by them as top-down learning. I am writing
this blog post to document and reflect on the things that I learned and to help
other people that may be interested getting started with the class.</strong></p>

<p>The fast.ai library is a high-level library based on PyTorch, which tries to
take a selection of best-practice approaches from cutting edge deep learning
research and make them into a collection of intelligent default settings.</p>

<p>Lesson 2 outlined the fundamentals of computer vision and building image
classification models. My homework: get my hands on my own image dataset and
use it to train a classifier myself. I chose to attempt a classifier that can
distinguish between sharks and dolphins, using images from google image search.
Read along for a detailed walk through below.</p>

<h2 id="getting-an-image-dataset">Getting an Image Dataset</h2>

<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/google-images-download/1.4.4/">This handy tool</a>
allows us to get images directly from google image search.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">bash
$ pip install google_images_download
</code></p>

<p>For more than 100 images we also need to install chromedriver and dependencies:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">bash
$ apt-get install python-selenium python3-selenium libxi6 libgconf-2-4 chromium-chromedriver
</code></p>

<p>Note that I had some problems with accessing the chrome driver from jupyter
notebooks. Changing ownership of the file with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">chmod 777  /usr/local/bin/chromedriver</code>
solved this for me.</p>

<p>Now we can run a query for images. Results are named as the number of the result
plus the original file name, downloaded, and saved locally. Note that you
should make sure to utilise the <code class="highlighter-rouge">usage_rights</code> flag in order to get images
that are cleared for this type of use.</p>

<p>```python
from google_images_download import google_images_download</p>

<p>os.chdir(‘/home/paperspace/data/sharksdolphins/’)
response = google_images_download.googleimagesdownload()</p>

<p>arguments = {
 “keywords”: ‘“shark”,”dolphin”’,
 “print_urls”: False,
 “limit”: “10000”,
 “output_directory”: “sharksdolphins/train/”,
 “format”: “jpg”,
 “usage_rights”: “labeled-for-nocommercial-reuse”,
 “chromedriver”: “/usr/local/bin/chromedriver”
}</p>

<p>response.download(arguments)</p>

<h1 id="func-for-renaming-an-image-file">func for renaming an image file</h1>
<p>def image_rename(file):
    file_index = re.match(r’\A\d*’, file).group(0)
    file_index = file_index.zfill(3)
    return file_index+’.jpg’</p>

<h1 id="func-for-renaming-all-files-in-a-folder">func for renaming all files in a folder</h1>
<p>def image_rename_all(folder):
    files = os.listdir(folder)
    [os.rename(folder+file, folder+image_rename(file)) for file in files]</p>

<h1 id="rename-files">rename files</h1>
<p>folders = [‘data/sharksdolphins/train/shark/’,
           ‘data/sharksdolphins/train/dolphin/’]
[image_rename_all(folder) for folder in folders]
```</p>

<p>The above query returned about 800 images each. I ended up speeding through
these images manually and removing unsuitable images manually.</p>

<p>We need a training and a validation set. Making this work with fast.ai is easily
done by adapting the recommended folder structure of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code> folder with two
sub-folders (<code class="highlighter-rouge">train</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">valid</code>), each of which have a subfolder with images
for each class.</p>

<p>The code chunk below takes the images downloaded earlier and randomly splits
them into 80% training data and 20% validation data. Don’t forget to set a
random seed so that your results stay reproducible.</p>

<p>```python
# split files into test and training set# split
PATH = ‘data/sharksdolphins/’
files_sharks = os.listdir(f’{PATH}train/shark’)
files_dolphins = os.listdir(f’{PATH}train/dolphin’)</p>

<h1 id="sample-from-each-class-to-create-a-validation-set">sample from each class to create a validation set</h1>
<p>np.random.seed(1234)
files_sharks_val = np.random.choice(
    files_sharks,
    size=round(len(files_sharks) / 5),
    replace=False,
    p=None)
files_dolphins_val = np.random.choice(
    files_dolphins,
    size=round(len(files_dolphins) / 5),
    replace=False,
    p=None)</p>

<h1 id="move-validation-set-images-into-validation-folder">move validation set images into validation folder</h1>
<p>[os.rename(PATH+’train/shark/’+file, PATH+’valid/shark/’+file)
  for file in files_sharks_val]
[os.rename(PATH+’train/dolphin/’+file, PATH+’valid/dolphin/’+file)
  for file in files_dolphins_val]
```
As you will see, collecting the data was the hardest part and
everyting from here onward is quite straight-forward thanks to the high level
abstractions provided by fast.ai</p>

<h2 id="training-a-model">Training a Model</h2>

<p>Now we can finally start to train our image classifier. I am using a
<a href="https://www.paperspace.com/console/machines">paperspace</a> instance with the
<a href="https://github.com/reshamas/fastai_deeplearn_part1/blob/master/tools/paperspace.md">setup</a>
recommended and provided by <a href="http://course.fast.ai/start.html">fast.ai</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Train a First Model</strong></p>

<p>```python
os.chdir(‘/home/paperspace/’)
# append fast.ai local folder to system path so modules can be imported
sys.path.append(‘/home/paperspace/fastai/’)
# automatically reload updated sub-modules
%reload_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
# in-line plots
%matplotlib inline</p>

<p>from fastai.imports import *
from fastai.transforms import *
from fastai.conv_learner import *
from fastai.model import *
from fastai.dataset import *
from fastai.sgdr import *
from fastai.plots import *
```</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">python
# set path of data folder
PATH = "data/sharksdolphins/"
# set size images should be resized to
sz = 224
# First model
arch = resnet34
data = ImageClassifierData.from_paths(PATH, tfms=tfms_from_model(arch, sz), bs=16)
learn = ConvLearner.pretrained(arch, data, precompute=True)
</code></p>

<p>Jeremy explained the learning rate finder that uses the approach of cyclical
learning rates as outlined by Leslie Smith (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186).
Using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lr_find</code> method and then plotting the learning rate against loss.
We now want to visually choose the “The highest learning rate we can find where
the loss is still clearly improving”. Note here that the learning rate finder
did initially not work so well for my small-ish dataset. I had to adjust the
batch size to make it work correctly
(see <code class="highlighter-rouge">bs=16</code> argument in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ImageClassifierData</code> call above)</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">python
learn.lr_find()
learn.sched.plot_lr()
</code></p>

<p>Over 93% accuracy! Really nice results already!</p>

<p>Let’s see if we can improve things even further.</p>

<p><strong>Train a Second Model</strong></p>

<p>Now let’s start training some of the lower layers and retraining these with
differential learning rate. Jeremy talks about unfreezing here, but a friend
that I talked to about this called it thawing instead, and I like that
terminology, as it implies the differential learning rates with fast-changing
weights at the last layer but slower updates in the lower layers.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">python
# unfreeze pretrained layers
learn.unfreeze()
# set differential learning rate
lr = np.array([1e-4,1e-3,1e-2])
# train new model
learn.fit(lr, 3, cycle_len=1, cycle_mult=2)

<p>A little bit better yet. Let’s look at the confusion matrix and
some of the misclassified images:</p>

<p>```python
# get predictions and transform to class probability values
log_preds = learn.predict()
preds = np.argmax(log_preds, axis=1)
probs = np.exp(log_preds[:,1])</p>

<h1 id="plot-confusion-matrix">plot confusion matrix</h1>
<p>from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(data.val_y, preds)
plot_confusion_matrix(cm, data.classes)
```</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fastai1_confusionmatrix.png" alt="confusion matrix" /></p>

<p>We should also plot some of the images to develop an intuition about where
our classifier does well and where it doesn’t. Here is the one misclassified
dolphin and the top 4 misclassified sharks:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fastai1_misclass_dolphin1.png" alt="misclassified dolphin" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/fastai1_missclass_shark1.png" alt="misclassified sharks" /></p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>You can see that we got some pretty strong results in a very short amount of
time and using a very limited dataset! There is obviously many more things that
could be done to improve this model further.</p>

<p><strong>Weighting the Classes</strong></p>

<p>In our example of sharks and dolphins, we are currently treating all
misclassifications equally. This may not be the right approach! If the model was
used to monitor a beach for sharks, for example, failing to recognize a dolphin
would not be a problem, while failing to recognize a shark could potentially
result in human fatalities. In this case, it might be advisable to retrain the
model with a biased weighting function to make sure our recall on shark images
is higher.</p>

<p><strong>Data Leakage</strong></p>

<p>Looking at images that were misclassified or low-confidence predictions, I
realised that my training set introduced a number of hidden biases to the model.
For example, a number of dolphin pictures have people in them that are touching
the dolphin. This is less prevalent with the shark pictures, for obvious
reasons. As a result, the few shark pictures with human arms and hands in them
and near the shark seem to end up with lower confidence for the shark class.
For the only misclassified dolphin in the dataset, on the other hand, I think
that the shark-like pose (frontal, widely opened mouth) may have played a role
in the model mistaking this image for a shark image.</p>

<p>This kind of data leakage is increasingly discussed and criticised in deep
learning applications, so it is good to be aware and keep an eye out for them.
Since my model is not going into production for Baywatch any time soon, I am
just glad I found it nicely illustrated in this relatively small dataset.</p>
