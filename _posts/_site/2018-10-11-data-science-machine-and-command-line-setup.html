<p><strong>Setting up a new machine for data science work can be frustrating and time
consuming. After having to go through this process twice quite recently, and
with several new starters about to join my team, I decided to invest some time
to create a step-by-step guide that helps to automate the process of machine
setup. This gets you from zero to Data Science in minutes on MacOS</strong></p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’ve had to set up a new machine twice in the last couple of months and got
frustrated with the tedious setup procedures. installing libraries, customising
settings, how do I switch RStudio to night mode again? So I decided to compile
a collection of scripts that make this process less painful. Moreover,
I have two new starters joining my team in the coming weeks and I hope that
this will help with the onboarding process and enable us to standardise the
machine configuration within the team.</p>

<p>There are three main components to my approach:</p>

<ol>
  <li>using command line tools and package managers to install applications
(instead of graphic installers), because this makes the setup faster, more
reproducible, and more easily maintainable.</li>
  <li>set up a beautiful, efficient, and powerful command line configuration,
because it’s awesome and because we can!</li>
  <li>create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.dotfile</code> repository that saves application preferences, api keys,
and access tokens, because it is more convenient and more secure than glueing
post-its to our monitor or hard-coding passwords and tokens into our code
that is then pushed to <a href="https://github.com/JanLauGe">GitHub</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most parts of this article can be used in isolation, so unlike the British
Prime Minister you are free to “cherry-pick” if you are so inclined.</p>

<p>I am assuming here that you’re using MacOS. Parts of it may be transferable to
a linux machine, much of it will need modification. If you’re on Windows…
good luck! It may work with the new ubuntu for Windows? If you
get a chance to test this, please let me know in the comment section below.</p>

<h1 id="initial-setup">Initial Setup</h1>

<p>We start of by installing install (Homebrew)[https://brew.sh/],
the “missing package manager for MacOS”! This bit actually requires some user
input (<yes> and <password>), so we will split that from the rest of the basic
installations.</password></yes></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</code></p>

<p>Once that is done we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">homebrew</code> for some additional household essentials.</p>

<p>```
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew cask install</p>

<p>brew install wget
brew install htop
brew install keychain</p>

<h1 id="java-sdk">Java SDK</h1>
<p>brew cask install java
# (this may require your password again)</p>

<p>brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install atom
brew cask install dropbox
# You can launch and configure dropbox with
open ~/Applications/Dropbox.app
```</p>

<h1 id="powerlevel9k-command-line">Powerlevel9k Command Line</h1>

<p>Now it’s time to beef up our command line. This is something that many
software developers and engineers spend a lot of time on, to the point where
some are holding competitions to show off their great shells. Many Data
Scientists, on the other hand, seem to neglect the command line. I think that
this is a mistake. Let me convince you by highlighting some of the neat extra
features that we can add with a little bit of extra setup effort:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nicer home path</li>
  <li>syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>auto completion</li>
  <li>read write flags</li>
  <li>execution timing</li>
  <li>git support with repo status tracking</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b5d7eb49a30bfe6bdb5706fa3c9be95fe8e5956e/687474703a2f2f67696679752e636f6d2f696d616765732f70396b6e65772e676966">powerlevel9k demo</a></p>

<p>The most nerdy set of productivity tools on the block!</p>

<p>We will need (iTerm2)[https://www.iterm2.com/] and (<code class="highlighter-rouge">zsh</code>)[http://www.zsh.org/].
iTerm2 is a macOS terminal replacement with many additional features, such as
more display customisation, better hotkeys, and fantastic split pane
functionality. <code class="highlighter-rouge">zsh</code> is a shell designed for interactive use and it works
particularly well with (<code class="highlighter-rouge">oh-my-zsh</code>)[https://ohmyz.sh/], a configuration tool
that helps with setting up everything just the way we like it. They have great
stickers, too ;)</p>

<p>While we’re at it we will also  install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">powerline</code> terminal fonts, which
will be needed for (<code class="highlighter-rouge">powerlevel9k</code>)[https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k],
the zsh theme of my choosing.</p>

<p>```
# install iTerm2
brew cask install iterm2</p>

<h1 id="install-zsh">install zsh</h1>
<p>brew install zsh
# get oh-my-zsh configuration tool
sh -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)”
# (this may require your password again)
sed -i ‘’ ’s/ZSH_THEME=”robbyrussell”/POWERLEVEL9K_MODE=’awesome-patched’\
ZSH_THEME=”powerlevel9k\/powerlevel9k”/g’ .zshrc</p>

<h1 id="get-powerlevel9k-theme-for-zsh">get powerlevel9k theme for zsh</h1>
<p>git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k
# change zsh theme to powerlevel9k
sed -i ‘’ ’s/ZSH_THEME=”robbyrussell”/POWERLEVEL9K_MODE=’awesome-patched’\
ZSH_THEME=”powerlevel9k\/powerlevel9k”/g’ .zshrc</p>

<h1 id="install-terminal-fonts">install terminal fonts</h1>
<p>wget -O /Library/Fontsfont_meslo_lg_r_powerline.ttf https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/Meslo%20Slashed/Meslo%20LG%20M%20Regular%20for%20Powerline.ttf?raw=true
wget -O /Library/Fonts/font_sourcecodepro_powerline_awesomeregular.ttf https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles/blob/master/fonts/SourceCodePro+Powerline+Awesome+Regular.ttf?raw=true
```</p>

<p>Now you should add iTerm2 to the dock bar and/or assign a hot key of your
choosing. Change the colour scheme (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Menu bar</code> &gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Profiles</code> &gt;
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Open Profiles...</code> &gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Select "Default"</code> &gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Edit Profiles...</code>) as you see fit.
Definitively change the font to <code class="highlighter-rouge">SourceCodePro+Powerline+Awesome Regular</code>.
This last step is important as POWERLEVEL9K WON’T WORK PROPERLY WITHOUT THIS
and you will end up with cryptic symbols on your prompt instead.</p>

<p>If you don’t have strong feelings about
colour style preference, feel free to use my profile template. You can install
it as a dynamic profile with the command below. DynamicProfiles enable you to
share your preferences between different machines. You can create your own by
exporting your profile from the profile menu to a JSON file and copying it to
the same location:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
# copy the profile settings for iTerm2 to DynamicProfiles folder
wget -O ~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/DynamicProfiles https://github.com/JanLauGe/.dotfiles/blob/master/iterm_profile.json
</code></p>

<p>There is also a wide range of plugins available for iTerm2 and zsh. I
automatically add a few that I find useful by installing them with homebrew or
cloning the code from github. Afterwards I add them to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code>
configuration file with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code>. Side note: Alternatively, we could just copy
a pre-existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code> but I felt that adding lines using <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code> kept things
more transparent and would allow for applying individual parts of the script
to already set up machines.</p>

<p>```
# Add auto suggestions (for Oh My Zsh)
# This plugin suggests the commands you used in your terminal history.
# You just have to type → to fill it entirely !

# Note: $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins path is by default ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins</p>

<p>brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
echo “source ${(q-)PWD}/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh” » ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc</p>

<p>(Data science at the command line)[https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/]
is great, but I doubt it will be enough to do all of your day-to-day tasks.
We need R &amp; Python, and while the GUI installers for
(Rstudio)[https://www.rstudio.com/] and (Anaconda)[https://www.anaconda.com]
make the installation child’s play, it would be nice to have it as part of this
initial setup script as well. Moreover, I find myself accumulating eclectic
collections of packages and libraries. Instead of reinstalling all of these
manually I have included them here as well:</p>

<p>```

<p>So now we are done with the basic setup on our local machine. However, there are
still ssh keys, api access tokens, and config files to configure. This can take
a lot of time and energy, and having different tokens on different machines
can be confusing or even unsafe (I have seen far too many people hard-code
their AWS credentials into their notebooks!).</p>

<p>I’ve therefore gone for an approach of creating a central repository for
identity management and protecting it with a single strong master password.
For obvious reasons I will not go into too much detail on my exact approach to
this, but let’s just say that we have synced all our identity files to a local
folder called <code class="highlighter-rouge">.dotfiles</code>.</p>

<p>From there we can source them into our <code class="highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code>.</p>

<h1 id="under-construction">Under Construction</h1>

<p>I am not quite done yet. Here is what’s missing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create ssh keys</li>
  <li>ssh add id</li>
  <li>RStudio defaults</li>
  <li>github config</li>
  <li>aws cli setup</li>
  <li>kaggle json</li>
  <li>latex</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll add some more info on that later on</p>
