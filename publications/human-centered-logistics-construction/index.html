        <p><b>Abstract.</b> 
          Logistics with real-time management of work activities at a construction site, including building materials and human resources, is an innovation for micro and small enterprises starting up in the construction sector. Enterprises of this size are being run using traditional turn-of-the-century technology tools, namely, excel spreadsheets as data storage. This paper presents a case study of technology implementation at a startup enterprise in the Belgian construction sector between 2018 and mid-2020, and discusses the challenges needed to overcome during the period of digital transformation. A multi-environment logistics platform was designed and prototyped following human-centered design principles enabling the enterprise to move forward and improve work methodologies to work with real-time data. Results after 18 months demonstrated an increased efficiency in all work processes, with a reduction of losses in all aspects of work activities and improved control of production estimates and measurements.

        <b>A final statement about Mental Health in Science</b> <br>
        It is found recurrently on the internet news and comments about another scientific researcher, in particular junior and medior researchers, going through some kind of mental health difficulties in particular those associated with sensory overload events. Promoted by abusive usage of wireless devices, assembled or modified to actuate at a distance and invisible, causing harm to a victim’s neurobiology. This is an old area of knowledge, that now needs to be openly discussed and commented, in a peaceful constructive way towards identification of solutions to all abusive usages of wireless frequency waves (radiation or vibration) in electronic devices. Open solutions are the correct path toward safety in usage of all things related to such technologies. Be knowledgeable to stay safe.
