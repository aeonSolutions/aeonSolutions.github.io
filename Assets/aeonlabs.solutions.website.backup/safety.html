	<h2 class="section__title"><strong>Safety in technology</strong></h2>
          <p>In technology and other social fields, the term "risk" has many clearly distinguishable meanings. In technology, risks are everywhere. As long as there are engineers, safety has always been the central issue of engineering. In the engineering ethics code, the responsibility of engineers to the safety of workers and the public is strongly emphasized. Technical risk and security are far from perfect terms. The definitions of key terms usually differ between different branches and engineering traditions. These differences largely depend on the lack of communication between different expert communities, but there are also normative or ideological factors in terminology confusion.</p>
          <p>Regarding the different uses of "risk" and "safety", different priorities can be expressed for the hazards for which preventive or mitigating measures should be taken. Identifying risks with expectations requires measuring the severity of results in digital form. Ideally, such measures should involve overall utility, in which case risk analysis becomes a branch of expected utility theory. In risk-return analysis, monetary value is used as a proxy for public utilities. In many engineering applications, the death count is used to simply measure the severity of the result. </p>
          <p>Although technology can be said to be the most important advancement of the last century, such as gene editing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the power of cloud computing, its leap is not without its shortcomings. The more interconnected worlds, the easier it is to share information, for better or for worse. Rampant cybercrime is enough to prove the dark side of technological progress. At the same time, technological advancement is already improving the safety and efficiency of our increasingly interconnected world. We integrated better online illegal activity monitoring to reduce human trafficking and generated big data that can help companies gather insights and create better products. We have established smart technologies that can help people monitor their health outside the doctor&rsquo;s office, and have established better agricultural management methods to increase the world&rsquo;s food supply. Now, technology has begun to provide citizens with new ways to monitor and better communicate potentially dangerous situations. Preparing to use technical tools to negotiate security conditions is an exciting next step in creating a safer society. </p>
          <p> Consider the following four areas, where technology is revolutionizing our security architecture: </p>
          <p>1. MEC and 5G can be publicly monitored immediately and action can be taken. Emergency responders can only get the information provided to them. Without accurate data on emergencies or current conditions, it is difficult to ensure the safety of citizens. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a new way to operate in the cloud, making cloud computing functions move closer and closer to users. MEC and 5G are extremely important in the field of public safety because first responders need fast and seamless communication and instant feedback. These technologies are 10 times faster than 4G, real-time analysis, video surveillance, and face and image recognition. This type of edge computing combined with artificial intelligence can respond to on-site security issues in real time. Visual assessments, alarms, activation of security systems, and door locks can all be done before the emergency personnel actually arrive. </p>
          <p>2. The innovation of Security Apps Empower emergency response technology has also begun to solve the gray area between actual 911 calls and potentially unsafe situations. For many criminal acts such as stalking, break-in or domestic abuse cases, unless it is too late to seek help, there is no clear danger. The phone application can help first responders determine the exact location and establish contact with other users who cannot call. New technologies such as Noonlight's connected security platform allow users to notify responders when they feel insecure. They can then execute or cancel the help request by pressing the button. Universities and cities also benefit from the big data of such technologies to better understand when and where people feel insecure, and focus their safety efforts on problem areas. This technique is also useful in situations where the victim's body cannot seek help. For example, last fall, Noonlight added the "Automatic Collision Detection and Response" function, which detects changes in the user's position, movement, and force. The platform can detect collisions of cars, bicycles and scooters, and automatically remind 911 to seek help from victims. </p>
          <p>3. IoT sensors monitor the safety and stress of workers. For people working in hazardous environments, wearable technology can help measure hazardous gas emission levels or unsafe behaviors that put workers at risk. In 2017, Parsons Corp., a technology-centric defense, security, and infrastructure company, began using radio frequency identification bracelets attached to workers' vests or helmets to monitor human-computer interaction. This technology helps the company measure the distance between workers and the equipment and the degree of safety standards established, ultimately reducing life-threatening incidents and sinister accidents between employees and machines.Companies such as Honeywell and Intel have also joined the cause by building "Connected Worker" security solutions. These sensors include wearable sensors that can help monitor posture, heart rhythm, exposure to toxic gases, etc. This data helps maintain the health and safety of industrial workers, firefighters, first responders and other high-risk labor. </p>
          <p>4. Wearable devices provide health insights for personalized treatment. Hazards do not always appear in the form of external forces; sometimes internal things threaten a person. In these cases, wearable technology can help ensure safety by monitoring health indicators and providing medical staff with accurate patient data. Wearables are all the rage in technology, and there are good reasons. Ultimately, many serious health conditions can be managed with less invasive and more effective methods than ever before. For example, KardiaBand can monitor heart rhythm and provide continuous ECG testing. The strap is worn as an Apple Watch strap and will alert the user when it detects an irregular heartbeat that indicates atrial fibrillation. For patients at risk of cardiac arrest, this wearable solution replaces bulky defibrillator vests. It provides monthly reports and reduces unnecessary emergency medical travel through instant analysis. Technology is changing the rules of the game in the field of public safety, and this development depends on our ability to communicate seamlessly. MEC and 5G, smart phone security applications, IoT sensors and wearable devices are just some of the innovative ways technology can contribute to a safer life and a safer society.</p>

          <h3 class="section__title">Issues</h3>
          <p>When referring to technology in a business environment, it usually refers to advancing an IT strategy or increasing productivity. However, technology is increasingly used for health and safety purposes in the workplace. Workplace safety deserves widespread attention, especially in industries such as mining and construction, where the workplace is full of dangers.Safety policy is an important part of managing these safety risks, but using the right tools also plays a big role. Digital technology is a powerful tool for workplace health and safety.For a long time, technology has played a vital role in workplace safety. There was a time when handheld two-way radios were high-tech, which facilitated long-distance communications and allowed workers to seek help when needed. </p>
          <p>Today, we can use more advanced technology, as well as exciting software and hardware to enhance workplace safety. 3D visualization and virtual reality To help employees understand their workplace, the company is using 3D visualization and virtual reality (VR) software to help create realistic images of the work environment.Although the cost of generating 3D models may seem to be an obstacle for some companies, in recent years, the cost of drones, cameras, and software have been greatly reduced, and computer processing capabilities have also continued to improve, thereby making the workplace Ability to recreate the work environment digitally. </p>
          <p>The oil, gas, construction and mining industries have been supporting this technology due to the fact that many jobs occur at heights or depths outdoors (Adjiski, Despodov and Serafimovski, 2017). Virtual reality technology can allow the exploration of dangerous workplaces without actually entering the environment or testing workplace design concepts that have been digitally modeled. </p>
          <p>The significance of training and workplace optimization is huge, which is why the industry has invested a lot of money in VR, even though it is a relatively new technology (Australian Institute of Engineers, 2017). High-speed communication, real-time data and schedule management can use technology to improve workplace safety. Another way is to use high-speed communication. For example, depending on the destination, workers who need to travel face various risks. </p>
          <p>Possible risks include fatigue to kidnapping. As a result, ensuring the safety of workers can be challenging. However, by using advanced reporting tools that can collect real-time data and transmit information, employers can better understand the health and safety of their employees. Satellite phones, GPS and GPS messengers can all be used to reduce the risks of long-distance travel and work travel. GPS messenger is one of the newer technologies available. It can automatically send location data to designated contacts, so that employers can track the location of remote workers and monitor whether they have reached their destination or whether there is a potential security risk (ART Security). There are also some systems that are fully integrated into the vehicle to monitor real-time data such as speed, braking and even traffic accidents (Shell Global). </p>
          <p>Wearable technology Wearable technology can monitor the health and safety of workers in real time, as well as monitor trends in pre-recorded data. Wearable devices are usually attached to clothing or as part of required PPE (such as safety glasses, vests, and helmets). Wearable devices capture data and provide feedback. They can track biological characteristics and even detect exposure limits of harmful elements. Organizations can also use wearable devices to determine whether the disease is work-related. This is especially helpful for solving cumulative diseases such as hearing loss, poisoning, respiratory diseases and skin diseases (design team staffing). Wearable devices such as safety vests have been used in the integration of wireless and Bluetooth technologies to connect the physical and digital worlds.They can create real-time indoor maps to track and understand the movement of people, equipment and materials, define hazardous areas and connect with worker locations to create safety bubbles (Mardonova &amp; Choi, 2018).</p>
          <p> Record-keeping technology also affects record-keeping and communication systems by improving the process of collecting and using information. For example, the electronic driver log allows automatic recording and has the ability to analyze data almost immediately (Cartesian), which improves driver safety and productivity by eliminating accidental errors caused by fatigue or mechanical failure.</p>
          <p>Conclusion The digital age provides technologies that enable people to work smarter and safer even in traditionally dangerous workplaces. Globally enhanced communications, digital modeling, virtual reality, wearable devices, and enhanced record keeping are all tools to improve security.</p>
