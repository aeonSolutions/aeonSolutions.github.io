# This Repository
This Repository holds the files of my GitHub page [aeonSolutions.github.io](https://aeonSolutions.github.io).
It was created using jekyll, markdown, javascript, and github. If you like it, feel free to reuse it.
I might add a blog post about the setup at some point.

# The Theme
The theme of this site is a modified version of Jekyll-Uno - a minimal, responsive theme for Jekyll based on the [Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/Uno) theme for Ghost. It was originally created by [Josh Gerdes](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno). It is under [the MIT license].

# To do
These things remain to be addressed:

* mathematical annotation from Markdown to html
* collapsible code snippets (particularly on mobile devices)
* size of headings (reduce by one?)
* code chunk background transparency
* add "share this post" to blog like http://fishyoperations.com/2014/12/12/new-blog.html
* could add custom url hosting like https://medium.com/@connorleech/launch-a-website-with-a-custom-url-using-github-pages-and-google-domains-3dd8d90cc33b
* optimise for search engines https://help.github.com/articles/search-engine-optimization-for-github-pages/
