### About me
“I am someone who is consistently growing themselves and who takes the time to continue learning even though it’s not a direct requirement of the job. I find that many times it’s a combination of what you study both directly and indirectly related to work”

Methods I most commonly use include optimization, supervised, and unsupervised machine learning methods (GLMs, boosted trees, k-means clustering) along with methods ensuring the validity and generalisability of my model results (cross-validation, lasso / elastic net regularization, bagging). I use components of the Hadoop ecosystem (such as Hive and Spark) to build systems that can handle large amounts of data, as well as cloud computing (AWS) to engineer reliable and scalable data pipelines.

Please have a look at the link section to find me in other places on the web, such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow.
